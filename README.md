# Welcome to the Logic20/20 Public SFDC/X Repo
*Logic20/20 is proud to be a Salesforc.com Consulting Partner. See [https://www.logic2020.com/salesforce](https://www.logic2020.com/salesforce) for more information about how we help Salesforce.com help business like yours.*

Our architects and developers seldom have time after a project completes to share tips, shortcuts, and pre-built components to the public before moving on to the next project. When they do, or take some personal time to contribute, the results will be published here. 

Currently, there are only two artifacts of note, though we think they are really useful:

- [Frequently used Salesforce CLI commands](sfdx-cli-common-commands.md)
- [Enabling all Admin Emails in new Sandboxes](README.SandboxAdminEmail.md)

The repository is laid out as an SFDX project. This format is for the convenience of testing before publishing. Our recommendation is to use the latest Salesforce SFDX project template for your own projects and only copy individual, useful artifacts from here as needed.
