# Welcome to the Logic20/20 Public SFDC/X Repo
Our architects and developers seldom have time after a project completes to share tips, shortcuts, and pre-built components to the public before moving on to the next project. When they do, or take some personal time to contribute, the results will be published here.

The repository is layed out as an SFDX project. This format is for the convenience of testing before publishing. Our recommendation is to use the latest Salesforce SFDX project template for your own projects and only copy individual, useful artifcats from here as needed.
